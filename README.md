# When Did I Last...?

Do you constantly forget to do things that you know are important?
Like, you know that it's a good thing if you talk to your friend
once in a while, but before you know it, suddenly it's been 6 months,
and you...just completely lost track of how long it had been?

Or maybe the same thing but for chores: change the bed. Vacuum. Empty
the fridge.

Or for activities: go for a walk. Play your guitar. Go to the park. 

_When Did I Last...?_ is a simple web app to help you record when you
last did _X_, for whatever _X_ you want to track.
